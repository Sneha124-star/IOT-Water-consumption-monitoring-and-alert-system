# Water-monitoring-and-alert-system
This app was built as a main project topic in the 4th year of my college. It was a group effort which successfully was completed.I handled the UI/UX part of the project.
This app is designed to track our day-to-day consumption of water in our household and alert us if we consume more that day. It comes with controlling the motor to pump water into the tank. The app notifies the user when the water level is low and the user can turn on the motor. The motor will shut down automatically when the water gets fully filled in the tank with the help of sensors attached so the user doesn't need to bother about turning off the motor. It shows the real-time water level in the tank and can calculate the water bill according to the consumption if required. Plot visual graph to show the statistics of water consumption on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis.

This app is built using a cross-platform framework for the mobile applications named flutter and backend as a service API named firebase. The language used to run the microcontroller is c++ in Arduino IDE.
